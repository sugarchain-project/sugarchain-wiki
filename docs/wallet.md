## Best Practises

### Desktop
#### Default data folder locations
```bash
Windows: %AppData%/Roaming/sugarchain
Mac: ~/Library/Application\ Support/sugarchain
Linux: ~/.sugarchain
```
Note that on mac and linux " ~/ " is the home folder, and is different from " / " root folder

#### Hot storage
Hot storage is a storage we usually mine to, and keep on a networked computer, a wallet we commonly access and use. It is preferable to have the computer the hot wallet is on as clean as possible, no unneeded software installed. Keep it updated. Have at least two copies(backups) of wallet.dat in two different locations, use dedicated USB sticks, that are marked clearly.

#### Cold storage
Cold storage is a wallet we create and have on a non-networked computer. This should be a dedicated disk, with a fresh and clean OS installed. To use this wallet we create the transaction, sign it and save it on a dedicated USB stick, then import this signed transaction into our hot wallet and broadcast it. Have at least two copies(backups) of wallet.dat in two different locations, use dedicated USB sticks, that are marked clearly.
