The world's fastest PoW blockchain with the most accurate halvings. Also, the first native SegWit (Bech32) built-in by default. 

Sugarchain lives up to the claim of “world’s fastest PoW blockchain” with a block time of 5 seconds. To implement this fast block time, a new difficulty adjustment algorithm was needed and we developed it. Unlike Zcash’s N17, SugarShield-N510 (based on Zcash’s modification of Digishield) is meant to have a steady and accurate re-targeting to a very fast block time. Regarding the "most accurate halvings" claim, Halving is everything, Bitcoin is valuable because its total supply has been strictly limited, unlike traditional currencies. This total supply is controlled only by that halving. There is nothing else. We made this halving better. The block reward should be to a power of two, so that it halves correctly, ie) 2^32/100000000 = 42.94967296 SUGAR. Halving schedule: Interval 12500000 blocks (5^8*32) which is about 2 years (exactly 1.9818619989852864… years). The total number of times halving will occur is 33 times, over a span of 66 years. Total supply: 1,073,741,824 SUGAR in theory, and 1073741823.875 SUGAR in actual. The difference is 0.125 SUGAR. One Satoshi (0.00000001) limitation makes this difference. In addition, this number is meaningful. FYI: 1 GB = 1073741824 Byte (2^30)
